* - Krishnan Srinivasan- srinivkn@mail.uc.edu
*
* Help Received:
* - Adedapo Alabi
*
* Developer comments: 
* Kartikey Pandey:
* Programmed different functions for the game and did the required testing to ensure that game *was working properly.
* Krishnan Srinivasan:
* Created certain functions that pertained to different rooms such as living room and room 1, and 
*helped come up with the storyline, also involved in testing and debugging. Learnt more about functions and function calls from working on this project.
